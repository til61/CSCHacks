## Project Description
*This is intentionally open-ended, but consider that people will be reading this to get a brief understanding of what you're working on.* Some ideas are:

* We want to make an H5 role-playing game javascript.
* We want to do this because making games is cool and it's an interesting new technology.
* Doing this will require learning javascript.
* We anticipate the following challenges: all the expected challenges surrounding learning a new language, problems with game debugging and just figuring out how an h5 game will work.
